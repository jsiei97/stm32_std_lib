This repo will download and adapt the stm32 std lib from ST, 
so it becomes more useful for FunTechCortexMX_gcc tool chain.

When you run get_std_lib.pl you either get the latest stdlib or the usb lib.
The script create a branch with the content of the downloaded zip, 
this has to be merged onto the master track manually.

This git repo can then be include in your projects git as a vendor branch.

Right now the files can be found at 
http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/product/164487.jsp#SOFTWARE_AND_DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS
but ST changes the URL now and then.
